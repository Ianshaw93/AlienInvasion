The following colour bar was intended to appear in the figure, it shows the occurrence of the emotions (i.e. log_count):

The figure is below which uses the x and y mean values for the circle centres; and the size of the circles are governed by the number of emotions with the particular log_count:

Conclusions
The largest circles are generally central; however pale in colour.

The darkest circles are very small and are not generally central, they are located in the negative x; and therefore appear to be positive emotions.
There are very few points that are located in the positive x; therfore the mean appear to be positve emotions.
There is one outlier that is very close to the max positive x.
